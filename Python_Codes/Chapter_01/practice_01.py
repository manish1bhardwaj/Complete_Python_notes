A man courageous and brave,
Had a role in removing the word slave,
From India and freeing it,
From the merciless rule of the British.

He sacrificed his life,
In the struggle to make India free,
A man devoted to his country,
Fought hard and made history.

While he was in jail he started,
A hunger strike and fasted,
For 116 days straight,
Without caring about his fate.

Arrested for the murder,
Of a British police officer,
John Saunders, he was arrested,
Subsequently hanged and convicted.

He was just 23 years of age,
When he was convicted and hanged,
By the merciless British’s rage,
He will be remembered till everlasting days.

When he was hanged,
He just smiled and passed,
Away from this world,
Leaving his revolting words.

A man courageous and brave,
Was not the British’s slave,
Devoted to his country,
He fought hard and made history.""")
